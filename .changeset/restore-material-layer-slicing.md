Restore per-layer slicing of single-solid walls/slabs with an `IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage`. Slicing turns one solid into one coloured sub-mesh per material layer (geometry_id = the layer's `IfcMaterial`) so the build-up is visible in 3D.

The slicing kernel stayed intact, but #874 (mesh-production unification) dropped the `set_material_layer_index` wiring from every pipeline, so the router's index was always `None` and `try_layered_sub_meshes` never fired — layered walls silently rendered as a plain single solid in the browser, native, and server paths. Re-wire it: build the `MaterialLayerIndex` once per load (cached on the IfcAPI for the streaming path, with a cheap substring bail-out so files with no layer set pay nothing) and attach it to every batch router. This also restores the "Merge Multilayer Walls" toggle for models whose sliceable walls carry their geometry as `IfcBuildingElementPart`s — the merged parent now actually draws its sliced solid instead of leaving a gap.
