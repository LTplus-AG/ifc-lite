Plumb the IFC measure type through the property pipeline so consumers can show units (issue #1573):

- `@ifc-lite/data`: `Property` gains an optional `dataType?: string` carrying the raw IFC measure value type (e.g. `"IFCVOLUMETRICFLOWRATEMEASURE"`) of a typed nominal value. Additive and optional; existing consumers are unaffected.
- `@ifc-lite/mutations`: the `PropertyExtractor` function type now carries the same optional `dataType?` per property, and `MutablePropertyView.getForEntity` preserves it through the base and mutation-merge paths, so a property's measure type survives the merge for unit display.
- `@ifc-lite/mcp`: `geometry_volume` / `geometry_area` now resolve the volume/area symbol from the file's declared `IfcUnitAssignment` (via `@ifc-lite/parser`'s `extractProjectUnits`) instead of hardcoding `m³` / `m²`, and report the resolved symbol in a new `unit` response field. Falls back to the SI default when the store has no source buffer or declares no such unit.
