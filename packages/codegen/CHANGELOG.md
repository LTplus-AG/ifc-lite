### Patch Changes

- [#1676](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1676) [`da04601`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/da0460183dcb4e2b26ceb53cfebd8cca33c78c39) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Docs refresh: correct stale README claims and API samples against the current codebase; add READMEs to the ten published packages that shipped without one (cli, create, sdk, sandbox, lens, lists, embed-sdk, embed-protocol, encoding, viewer-core).

- [#1678](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1678) [`a90182b`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/a90182bac110fdd4c15b8b51866e31deefc0378e) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Package metadata hygiene: correct the @ifc-lite/codegen license field to MPL-2.0 (the source has always carried MPL headers; the MIT value was a scaffolding accident) and give it a files allowlist so the npm tarball ships dist, schemas, and README instead of the whole package directory. Add the missing publishConfig, homepage, and bugs fields to codegen, embed-protocol, embed-sdk, and wasm, and homepage/bugs to create-ifc-lite, matching the rest of the workspace.

## 1.15.4

### Patch Changes

- [#1151](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1151) [`bfd9004`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/bfd9004daa17f481a7b33b5c3c11f620e6cd894d) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - De-duplicate the STEP serializer into a single source of truth. The
  schema-agnostic STEP serialization logic (`serializeValue`, `generateHeader`,
  `parseStepValue`, `ref`/`enumVal`/`isEntityRef`/`isEnumValue`, and the
  registry-injected `toStepLineWithRegistry` / `generateStepFileWithRegistry`)
  previously existed as four hand-synced copies — the codegen template plus three
  generated `serializers.ts` files — which had already silently drifted (the
  runtime copy carried a `?? []` hardening the template lacked). It now lives once
  in `@ifc-lite/data`; the per-schema bundles (parser runtime + codegen outputs)
  are thin re-exports that only bind their own `SCHEMA_REGISTRY` to the
  registry-coupled helpers, so the copies can never diverge again. A codegen test
  asserts the generated bundle stays a thin re-export rather than re-inlining
  logic.

  Also fixes the broken `generate:ifc4` script (it pointed at a non-existent
  `schemas/IFC4.exp`; the real file is `schemas/IFC4_ADD2_TC1.exp`). No public
  behaviour change: `@ifc-lite/parser` re-exports the same serializer symbols as
  before; `@ifc-lite/data` gains the shared primitives; `@ifc-lite/codegen` now
  declares `@ifc-lite/data` as a dependency since the generated bundle imports it.

- [#1143](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1143) [`248f2c0`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/248f2c09a4d61fa27dfeaba5511a2a641d4cd278) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Preserve source IFC HEADER fields on round-trip export. Re-exporting an
  imported file previously regenerated a fresh ifc-lite header, silently dropping
  the source `FILE_DESCRIPTION` items (any `ViewDefinition [...]` label and vendor
  identifier / coordinate-reference strings) and flattening the exact
  `FILE_SCHEMA` token (e.g. `IFC4X3_ADD2` → `IFC4X3`, which some toolchains
  reject).

  The parser now captures the verbatim HEADER onto a new
  `IfcDataStore.sourceHeader` (`IfcSourceHeader`, exported from `@ifc-lite/data`;
  parser also exports `parseSourceHeader`), threaded through the worker transport.
  `StepExporter` reproduces the source `FILE_DESCRIPTION` items and the exact
  `FILE_SCHEMA` token when not converting schemas, falling back to parsing the
  source bytes for cache-restored stores. Provenance stays honest:
  `preprocessor_version` is set to `ifc-lite` while the source authoring tool is
  kept as `originating_system`, and when mutations exist exactly one
  `Re-exported by ifc-lite, N modification(s)` item is appended without removing
  the source items. `generateHeader` now accepts description/author/organization
  arrays plus a free-form schema token and STEP-escapes all fields; it also emits
  a properly parenthesised `FILE_DESCRIPTION` list (the prior single-string form
  was malformed STEP). Created-from-scratch (`IfcCreator`) and federated/merged
  exports are unaffected — they keep their own provenance headers by design.

## 1.15.3

### Patch Changes

- [#946](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/946) [`6378998`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/6378998ec146f7f9297ef5fcc5953b155fd6b5e0) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Fix a batch of verified findings from a full-codebase review (security, correctness,
  data-loss, and resource/memory leaks). Highlights:

  **Security**

  - collab-server: a malformed WebSocket frame no longer crashes the whole process
    (decode is wrapped; a bad frame is rejected/audited instead of throwing).
  - mcp: the local HTTP transport now validates `Host`/`Origin` and no longer sends a
    wildcard `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, closing a DNS-rebinding/CSRF hole; the
    `AuthScope.modelIds` allowlist is now enforced at model resolution.
  - server-bin: `extractZip` uses `execFileSync` (argv, no shell), removing command
    injection via archive/destination paths.
  - export / sdk / cli / mcp / lists / viewer CSV exporters now neutralize spreadsheet
    formula injection (CWE-1236) consistently.
  - create-ifc-lite: validates the project name (no path traversal) and drops the
    unused `execSync`-based downloader.
  - embed-sdk: inbound `postMessage` now validates `event.origin`.

  **Correctness / data-loss**

  - parser: `lengthUnitScale` survives the worker transport; the nested STEP list
    parser is string-aware (commas/parens inside quoted values no longer mis-split).
  - mutations: deleting a property from a session-created pset and replaying
    `UPDATE_ATTRIBUTE` / `CREATE_PROPERTY_SET` mutations now work.
  - export: merged-export ID remapping no longer rewrites `#N` inside quoted strings.
  - drawing-2d: GPU section cutter triangle upload/readback use correct WGSL std-layout
    offsets and strides.
  - ifcx: cyclic children no longer abort the parse; spatial children round-trip; the
    mesh transform guards a zero/non-finite homogeneous `w`.
  - data / cache: a `NULL` string property value stays `null` instead of becoming `""`.
  - pointcloud, bcf, server-client, query, viewer-core, viewer store/federation: assorted
    decoding, federation-id, and selection-state fixes.

  **Resource / memory leaks**

  - geometry, query (DuckDB), renderer (GPU buffers), collab (federation presence),
    sandbox (host log capture + runtime), mcp (clash mesh cache), server-bin (signal
    listeners), and the viewer renderer on unmount now release resources deterministically.

  **Hardening (apps, not published)**

  - server: a dedicated `server-release` Cargo profile (`panic = "unwind"`) plus a
    `CatchPanicLayer` contain a malformed-IFC parse panic to the offending request
    instead of aborting the whole server.
  - desktop (Tauri): a Content-Security-Policy is set, and unused `shell:*` /
    `fs:allow-write|mkdir|remove` capabilities (and the unused shell plugin) are removed.

  **Second pass** (additional verified findings)

  - collab-server: S3 log load now follows `ListObjectsV2` pagination (no dropped frames);
    awareness frames are size-capped + rate-limited; path-lock verify runs after role/rate-limit;
    the blob route requires auth and `/metrics` can be token-gated.
  - server-bin: downloaded binaries are SHA-256 verified against a release sidecar (fail-closed on
    mismatch, warn-if-absent for older releases).
  - extensions: inner-ring capability check fails _closed_ for unknown namespaces; signing
    canonicalization is now injective (length-prefixed).
  - correctness/leaks: mutations quantity type+unit preserved on replay; `findByProperty` boolean
    comparisons; Parquet REAL columns kept as Float64; blob GC fail-safe on missing `uploadedAt`;
    spatial-hierarchy + codegen cycle guards; BVH NaN edge; bSDD/playground caches bounded;
    point-cloud GPU asset freed on federation error; mcp `parseColor` rejects non-hex; bcf/SVG/STEP
    output escaping; and more.
