### Minor Changes

- [#2589](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2589) [`9175e35`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/9175e35b29ff57b39b671e5db33f38c7807fb0fd) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Add `addSpatialZonesToStore`, an anchored builder for `IfcSpatialZone`.

  A location zone (a takt area, a construction section) is emitted as
  `IfcSpatialZone` rather than `IfcZone`: that type groups spaces, so assigning
  walls to one produces a file most readers, this one included, mis-read. Elements
  attach through `IfcRelReferencedInSpatialStructure`, which is many-to-many and
  additive, so emitting zones never re-parents anything and an element straddling
  two zones can belong to both.

  Boxes emit an `IfcRectangleProfileDef` with any rotation carried in the
  placement; a convex footprint emits the polygon instead. `spatialZonesSupported`
  reports whether the target schema has the type at all, since IFC2X3 does not.

  `IfcRoot.OwnerHistory` is optional from IFC4 onward but mandatory in IFC2X3. `resolveSpatialAnchor` previously resolved `ownerHistoryId: null` for any store missing `IfcOwnerHistory`, regardless of schema, and every in-store builder (`addWallToStore`, `addBeamToStore`, `addSlabToStore`, ...) emits `$` for a null `ownerHistoryId` unconditionally. Editing an IFC2X3 store that itself is missing `IfcOwnerHistory` (a malformed or hand-edited file) therefore silently authored new IFC2X3 elements with `$` in place of a mandatory attribute. IFC4/IFC4X3 stores are unaffected — OwnerHistory is genuinely optional there and `$` is correct.

Replaced with an explicit `byteLength` check.

  No behavior change for real callers: every current call site passes a store this same process just parsed, which always has resident source bytes. Verified with a synthetic empty-source store that the function still fails closed (throws) rather than silently misresolving, in both the old and the new code.

### Patch Changes

- [#2100](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2100) [`befc108`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/befc1083e377315231006352cb3fe95949e92b47) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Stop four package-level failures from being reported as ordinary results.

  - `@ifc-lite/data` / `@ifc-lite/cache`: a List-typed property with no value
    came back as `[]` — a real empty list — because the NULL string sentinel
    resolved to `''` and the resulting `JSON.parse` throw was swallowed. NULL
    now reads as `null`, matching the string branch beside it, and a genuinely
    unparseable list value logs once (latched) before falling back to `[]`.
  - `@ifc-lite/create`: `extractWallSegmentsForStorey` silently defaulted to a
    metre length-unit scale when unit extraction threw, mis-scaling every
    extracted wall segment on a millimetre model. It now warns with the error,
    matching `resolveSpatialAnchor` / `resolveDuplicateSource`.
  - `@ifc-lite/cli`: `ifc-lite schema` printed a reduced built-in schema as if
    it were the full SDK surface when `@ifc-lite/sandbox/schema` could not be
    loaded; it now says so on stderr and exits non-zero (stdout is still pure
    JSON, unchanged shape), so a piping caller that discards stderr still sees
    the failure. `--version` no longer reports a hard-coded `0.4.0` when
    `package.json` is unreadable — it reports `0.0.0-unknown` and explains why
    on stderr.
  - `@ifc-lite/geometry`: the shard and finalise paths that fall back from a
    SharedArrayBuffer view to a materialised (file-sized) copy now say so once
    per worker, matching the streaming-prepass path that already did.

### Major Changes

- [#1979](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1979) [`8f139a8`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/8f139a8ef44235b68c2f97c032419fa586111b62) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - **BREAKING:** every `IfcCreator` element constructor now places its product relative to the storey it is added to. Element coordinates are storey-relative across the whole API.

  ## What was wrong

  `IfcCreator` chained the product's `IfcLocalPlacement` to a different parent depending on which method you called. Seven methods — `addIfcWall`, `addIfcSlab`, `addIfcColumn`, `addIfcBeam`, `addIfcStair`, `addIfcRoof`, `addIfcGableRoof` — chained to the storey placement, which carries `[0, 0, Elevation]`. The other 21 — `addIfcDoor`, `addIfcWindow`, `addIfcRamp`, `addIfcRailing`, `addIfcPlate`, `addIfcMember`, `addIfcFooting`, `addIfcPile`, `addIfcSpace`, `addIfcCurtainWall`, `addIfcFurnishingElement`, `addIfcBuildingElementProxy`, `addIfcCircularColumn`, `addIfcIShapeBeam`, `addIfcLShapeMember`, `addIfcTShapeMember`, `addIfcUShapeMember`, `addIfcHollowCircularColumn`, `addIfcRectangleHollowBeam`, `addElement`, `addAxisElement` — chained to the world.

  On a storey with a non-zero `Elevation`, a caller mixing the two families got two datums in one model, with no error and nothing downstream to notice. Measured on a real scan-to-IFC run: the storey and its spaces at −1.368653 m, the walls at −2.737307 m — exactly 2 × the elevation, standing 1.37 m below the spaces they bounded.

  Every one of these methods already took the storey as its first argument and already emitted an `IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure` into it. Only the placement disagreed.

  ## Why storey-relative, and not world-relative

  The placement hierarchy has to agree with the containment hierarchy. A product contained in a storey whose placement chains past that storey to the world is not a coherent IFC product: moving the storey leaves its own contents behind, and `IfcBuildingStorey.Elevation` and the storey's `ObjectPlacement` become decoration that no geometry honours. The world-relative alternative would have meant deleting the storey's `[0, 0, Elevation]` placement or leaving it as a transform nothing chains to — the wrong half of the schema to surrender.

  It is also what the rest of this package already did: the `*ToStore` builders (`addWallToStore`, `addSpaceToStore`, `addDoorToStore`, …) have always chained from `anchor.storeyPlacementId`. Choosing world would have split `@ifc-lite/create` against itself.

  ## Migrating

  If your storeys all have `Elevation: 0`, nothing moves — the storey placement is the identity and the two parents were already the same point.

  Otherwise, for the 21 methods listed above: **stop adding the storey elevation to element coordinates.** Pass the height above that storey's floor.

  ```ts
  const storey = creator.addIfcBuildingStorey({
    Name: "Level 1",
    Elevation: 3.2,
  });

  // before — absolute Z, because addIfcSpace ignored the storey
  creator.addIfcSpace(storey, {
    Position: [0, 0, 3.2],
    Width: 4,
    Depth: 4,
    Height: 2.6,
  });

  // after — storey-relative Z, like addIfcWall always was
  creator.addIfcSpace(storey, {
    Position: [0, 0, 0],
    Width: 4,
    Depth: 4,
    Height: 2.6,
  });
  ```

  If you compensated for the asymmetry — passing absolute Z to the world-parented methods and storey-relative Z to the storey-parented ones, so the two families lined up — remove the compensation from the world-parented calls only. The storey-parented calls were already correct and must not change. A caller that had settled on `Z = 0` for walls and `Z = elevation` for spaces now passes `Z = 0` to both.

  `addIfcWallDoor` and `addIfcWallWindow` are unaffected: they were and remain wall-local, and inherit the storey datum through their host.

  Also in this release: `getStoreyPlacement` throws `Unknown storeyId #N` instead of silently falling back to the world placement. This is a strictly earlier version of the error `trackElement` already threw a few lines later, so no working call changes — it just means a bogus storey id no longer emits orphan placement entities before failing.

  ## `@ifc-lite/sandbox`

  The `llmSemantics.placement` metadata in `NAMESPACE_SCHEMAS` is corrected to match: the seven methods previously tagged `'world'` (`addIfcMember`, `addIfcPlate`, `addIfcCurtainWall`, `addIfcRailing`, `addIfcDoor`, `addIfcWindow`, `addAxisElement`) are now `'storey-relative'`, and the `useWhen`/`cautions` prose that described them as world-placement is rewritten. The `MethodPlacementKind` union is unchanged and no export was added or removed. Consumers that read `placement` to generate guidance will see different values for those seven methods — which is the point: the old values now describe behaviour that no longer exists.

  Thirteen constructors that carried no `llmSemantics` at all — `addIfcRamp`, `addIfcFooting`, `addIfcPile`, `addIfcSpace`, `addIfcFurnishingElement`, `addIfcBuildingElementProxy`, `addIfcCircularColumn`, `addIfcHollowCircularColumn`, `addIfcIShapeBeam`, `addIfcLShapeMember`, `addIfcTShapeMember`, `addIfcUShapeMember`, `addIfcRectangleHollowBeam` — now declare `placement: 'storey-relative'` with their coordinate keys. They were invisible to every consumer that groups methods by placement frame, so nothing generated from this schema said which datum their coordinates were in. `NAMESPACE_SCHEMAS.create` now tags all 30 coordinate-taking constructors (27 storey-relative, `addElement` explicit-placement, and the two wall-local hosted inserts).

  ## Downstream packages carrying the break

  The behaviour change is not confined to `@ifc-lite/create`: four packages re-expose `IfcCreator` and therefore ship it to their own consumers. Each is versioned to say so, rather than letting a caller pick the change up through a range they believed was compatible.

  - **`@ifc-lite/sdk` (major)** — re-exports the class directly (`packages/sdk/src/index.ts`: `export { IfcCreator } from '@ifc-lite/create'`). Without a major, a consumer on `^1.21` accepts the release and gets storey-relative placement with no signal.
  - **`@ifc-lite/sandbox` (major, was minor)** — `buildCreateMethods()` auto-discovers `IfcCreator.prototype` and dispatches to it, so every affected constructor is reachable from sandbox scripts. A script passing absolute coordinates against a non-zero-elevation storey now emits geometry one elevation off. That is breaking for the script author even though the sandbox's own surface is unchanged.
  - **`@ifc-lite/cli` (minor)** — `create` constructs `IfcCreator` and passes `--elevation` straight through, so the same shift reaches CLI users following the previous absolute-coordinate convention. Minor rather than major because the package is pre-1.0, where the house rule maps a breaking change to a minor bump.
  - **`@ifc-lite/mcp` (minor)** — exposure is indirect but real: `loadIfcModel()` (`src/index.ts`) returns a `LoadedModel` carrying `bim: BimContext` (`src/loader.ts`), whose `create` namespace constructs the class (`@ifc-lite/sdk` `namespaces/create.ts`: `project()` returns `new IfcCreator(params)`, `building()` takes a `StoreyElevation`). A library consumer calling `model.bim.create.building({ StoreyElevation })` gets the new datum. Minor for the same pre-1.0 reason as the CLI.

  `@ifc-lite/wasm` is unaffected — it neither constructs nor re-exports `IfcCreator`, directly or through a namespace. The viewer apps are private and unpublished.

### Minor Changes

- [#1887](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1887) [`87f3507`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/87f3507f6fb67a3fd834a190737ea33d7e9ad661) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Thread `@ifc-lite/encoding`'s `RandomSource` through the in-store builders: `SpatialAnchor.guidRandom` seeds every GlobalId the anchored builders emit (`addWallToStore`, `addSlabToStore`, `addColumnToStore`, `addBeamToStore`, `addDoorToStore`, `addWindowToStore`, `addSpaceToStore`, `addRoofToStore`, `addPlateToStore`, `addMemberToStore`, plus the shared emit helpers), `DuplicateInStoreOptions.guidRandom` does the same for `duplicateInStore`, and `generateSpacesFromWalls` / `generateSpaces` forward `options.guidRandom`. Same seeded source in, identical GlobalIds out - the in-store counterpart of `ProjectParams.GuidSource` from the previous release. Defaults unchanged (platform CSPRNG).

- [#1879](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1879) [`8799484`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/87994844a5edb66404fa12b0719c89f5ec026c4d) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Opt-in determinism hooks for reproducible IFC generation. `generateUuid` and `generateIfcGuid` accept an optional `RandomSource` (a `() => number` in `[0, 1)`) so GUIDs can be drawn from a seeded generator, and `IfcCreator` gains `ProjectParams.Timestamp` (fixed creation instant for the STEP header, IfcOwnerHistory and work-schedule defaults) and `ProjectParams.GuidSource` (deterministic GlobalId source). Same options twice yields byte-identical output; defaults are unchanged (wall clock + platform CSPRNG).

### Patch Changes

They previously cleared the `Number.isFinite` guard and failed much later as a `RangeError` from `toISOString()` while writing the file header; they are now rejected in the constructor, where the error can still name the parameter. Also corrects the `RandomSource` documentation: the unseeded path uses Web Crypto when the runtime provides it and falls back to `Math.random` when it does not, rather than guaranteeing a platform CSPRNG.

  - `@ifc-lite/create`: `IfcCreator` now generates spec-valid 128-bit GlobalIds via the canonical `@ifc-lite/encoding` encoder (previously ~94% of generated ids failed `isValidIfcGuid` and silently changed identity on guid→uuid→guid round-trips, e.g. in BCF).
  - `@ifc-lite/export`: schema-downgrade `IFCPROXY` placeholders now carry spec-valid GlobalIds instead of synthetic `PROXY_…` markers.
  - `@ifc-lite/parser`: `extractLengthUnitScale` now mirrors the canonical Rust extractor when an `IfcMeasureWithUnit` ValueComponent is unreadable — defaults the value to 1.0 and still applies the UnitComponent SI-prefix instead of falling through to metres (property scaling can no longer desync from geometry scaling).
  - `@ifc-lite/geometry`: removed the dead legacy worker protocol (`process`/`prepass`/`prepass-fast` messages) — the streaming protocol (`stream-start`/`stream-chunk`/`stream-end` + `prepass-streaming`) is the only path; the wasm `buildPrePassFast` export is gone. Streaming pre-pass loads now apply aggregate void propagation (window/door cuts on aggregated parts) in parity with one-shot loads and the server.
  - `@ifc-lite/server-client`: `ProcessingStats` gains optional `total_csg_failures` / `products_with_failures` fields — the server now reports the same CSG failure diagnostics the browser console shows.

  declared `import` + `types`, so any resolver hitting the CJS/default
  condition path (tsx, jest, plain `require`, some bundlers) failed with
  ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED. The `default` entry points at the same
  ESM dist file; pure ESM consumers are unaffected.

  native length unit. Wall, slab, beam, column, door, window, roof, plate,
  and member wrote metre coordinates regardless of the file's length unit —
  an element added to a millimetre model (typical Revit export) serialized
  1000× too small, while its in-session mesh (built separately in renderer
  metres) looked correct until the export round-trip. The duplicate flow
  had the inverse bug: its metre offset was added to the source's
  native-unit location, so a duplicate in a mm file landed ~1000× too
  close (visually on top of the source). Door/window OverallHeight /

### Minor Changes

- [#1022](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1022) [`7bd0459`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/7bd045963b1339a35bd73d1aad18ff29de7db692) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - feat(spaces): interactive Space Sketch (DCEL) editor + headless generation

  A topology-aware space editor built on a persistent half-edge (DCEL) plate in
  the Rust geometry core, exposed via a stateful `SpacePlateHandle` wasm binding:

  - **Derive** rooms from a storey's walls, **drag** a shared vertex (both rooms
    follow), **split** a room between corners _or_ new nodes added anywhere on a
    wall, **merge** rooms across a shared wall, with undo/redo, and **bake** to
    real `IfcSpace` (via the existing `addSpace` path).
  - **Wall-axis recognition fixes** in `@ifc-lite/create`: read the extractor's
    reliable entity type instead of the columnar table's `'Unknown'` sentinel
    (every `Curve2D` Axis polyline — e.g. all of AC20-FZK-Haus — was skipped), and
    a body-footprint fallback (face sets, `IfcFacetedBrep`, vertically-extruded
    rect / arbitrary / IndexedPolyCurve profiles) for walls without an Axis.
  - Viewer "Space Sketch" tool: storey list with resolved names, auto-derive on
    selection, auto-escalating + manual snap tolerance to close centreline corner
    gaps.
  - **Headless generation** — derive IfcSpace across storeys from the CLI
    (`ifc-lite generate-spaces`), the SDK (`bim.spaces.generate`), or as a library
    function (`generateSpaces` from `@ifc-lite/create`), with auto-escalating snap,
    storey-datum ("slab") floor-to-floor heights, and rectangular corner cleanup
    ported into the TS detector.
  - **Production-grade baked spaces** — every derived `IfcSpace` now carries
    `Qto_SpaceBaseQuantities` (GrossFloorArea / NetFloorArea / GrossPerimeter /
    Height / GrossVolume, schema-aware) and an `IfcRelSpaceBoundary` per bounding
    wall. Generated spaces are stamped with `ObjectType 'IfcLite:GeneratedSpace'`,
    and a re-run skips a model that already contains them (idempotent; `--force`
    to override).

### Patch Changes

- [#1029](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1029) [`cef9989`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/cef99897ee287029c6db6bbaafcd2a35508af1be) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - fix(renderer): double-sided GPU pick pass — back-face culling could cull an
  element's entire camera-facing surface (IFC winding order varies), so clicks
  selected whatever was behind it (e.g. an IfcSpace behind a wall).

  fix(create): space bakes now survive the IFC round-trip —
  `addSpaceToStore` emits geometry in the model's native length unit
  (a space baked into a millimetre model used to export 1000× too small),
  and `resolveSpatialAnchor` no longer fails on models without
  `IfcOwnerHistory` (OPTIONAL from IFC4 onward); builders emit `$` instead.

  fix(viewer): Space Sketch surfaces real bake errors instead of counting
  them as "already a space" skips, reveals the (persisted) Spaces class
  visibility after a successful bake, and the toolbar button is edit-mode
  gated with a distinct icon.

### Minor Changes

- [#598](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/598) [`25c9877`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/25c9877969d2dcccb9c4e61f57b188cbf5fbbc3c) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Auto Spaces — diagnostics, broader wall coverage, and a sweep of
  review feedback.

  **Auto Spaces detection.** The "no enclosed regions detected"
  failure mode now surfaces actionable counts — both in devtools
  and in the panel itself.

  - `extract-walls.ts` now tries the standard `Axis` representation
    (`IfcShapeRepresentation` with `RepresentationIdentifier='Axis'`,
    `IfcPolyline` items) **before** falling back to the
    `addWallToStore` rectangle-profile convention. That covers
    walls authored by Revit / ArchiCAD / IfcOpenShell — the previous
    extractor only handled walls placed via the Add Element tool.
    The placement chain is read once and the polyline endpoints are
    transformed through it, so rotated walls work.
  - Every wall that gets dropped is recorded with a typed reason
    (`no-axis-or-rect-profile`, `placement-not-resolvable`,
    `zero-length-axis`, …) — the panel summarises them as
    `"3× no-axis-or-rect-profile, 1× zero-length-axis"`.
  - `detectEnclosedAreas` exposes a
    `detectEnclosedAreasWithStats(...)` companion that returns
    per-stage counts (vertices, edges-after-split, faces total,
    outer / below-min-area drops, largest area). The intersection
    splitter's iteration cap now scales with input size
    (`max(100, segments * 10)`) so dense floor plans don't bail
    out early.
  - `generateSpacesFromWalls` always logs a `console.info`
    one-liner and threads a new `debug?: boolean` flag down to the
    extractor + detector for verbose tracing. The viewer's Auto
    Spaces panel exposes a "Verbose console logging" checkbox.
  - The Auto Spaces diagnostic block now shows the graph stats
    (`123v / 456e / 78f`), the drop counts, and per-reason wall
    skips. Two amber hints fire automatically when walls were
    extracted but no faces formed (likely snap tolerance), or
    when nothing extracted (likely an unsupported geometry shape).

  **Review-feedback sweep (PR #598).**

  - `addElementMeshes.linearBox()` and the SVG `linearBoxCorners`
    helper honour each endpoint's Y so a sloped beam previews as
    a sloped prism instead of being flattened to the start.
  - `bridge-store.requireStoreyId` rejects `0` (EXPRESS ids are
    1-based, `#0` is never valid).
  - `addWindow` / `addDoor` `tsParamTypes` include
    `UserDefinedPartitioningType` / `UserDefinedOperationType`
    so typed sandbox callers can hit the IFC4 round-trip without
    casts.
  - `AnnotationLayer.resolveEntityType` no longer falls back to
    `ifcDataStore` when the annotation's `modelId` is missing
    from a federated `models` map (would resolve the wrong
    entity in multi-model sessions). Single-model sessions keep
    the fallback.
  - `addDoorToStore` / `addWindowToStore` validate
    `OperationType` / `PartitioningType` against the IFC4 enum
    and re-route unknown values through
    `.USERDEFINED.` + `User-defined…Type` so custom labels
    round-trip cleanly.
  - `addWallToStore` defaults `PredefinedType` to `.NOTDEFINED.`
    (was `.STANDARD.`) to match the rest of the in-store
    builders.
  - `duplicateInStore` / `resolveDuplicateSource` allow
    `OwnerHistory` to be `null` (IFC4 made it optional). The
    duplicate emits a bare `$` token instead of `#null` for the
    omitted case.
  - `StoreEditor.addEntity` accepts an injected schema-aware
    normalizer (`setEntityTypeNormalizer`); `@ifc-lite/sdk`
    registers `normalizeIfcTypeName` + `isKnownType` at load
    time so direct callers — CLI scripts, sandbox bridge,
    unit tests — see registry-grade rejection of typos like
    `IfcWal`, plus canonical PascalCase on `EntityRef.type`.

- [#598](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/598) [`25c9877`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/25c9877969d2dcccb9c4e61f57b188cbf5fbbc3c) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Auto Spaces — generate IfcSpace volumes from a storey's walls.

  Pick the **Space** type in the Add Element panel and the new **Auto
  Spaces** section appears underneath the dimensions. Hit **Preview** to
  see every enclosed region the wall graph forms (live SVG overlay,
  labelled with area), then **Generate** to commit one IfcSpace per
  region. Settings: snap tolerance (collapse sloppy wall ends), min area
  (drop closets and slivers), height (extrusion), name pattern, and
  IfcSpaceTypeEnum.

  **`@ifc-lite/create`** — three new modules, all parser-pure:

  - `auto-space-detect.ts` — planar-graph face finder. Snap →
    resolve crossings → DCEL half-edge graph → leftmost-turn cycle
    walk → drop unbounded faces → filter by min area. Handles
    multi-component layouts (two non-touching rooms find both),
    T-junctions, and snap-induced corner merges. 8 fixture tests.
  - `extract-walls.ts` — pulls every wall axis on a target storey
    from a parsed `IfcDataStore`. Walks
    IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure → IfcWall → placement chain →
    IfcRectangleProfileDef.XDim. Optional overlay reader includes
    walls created via the Add Element tool without a re-parse.
  - `generate-spaces.ts` — orchestration: extract → detect → emit
    via `addSpaceToStore` polygon mode. `dryRun` runs detection only.

  **`@ifc-lite/viewer`** — `mutationSlice.generateSpacesFromWalls`
  returns the detection result. `AddElementPanel` gains the Auto Spaces
  section; `AddElementOverlay` projects detected outlines back to screen
  using the storey's elevation so the preview tracks the camera in
  real time.

- [#598](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/598) [`25c9877`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/25c9877969d2dcccb9c4e61f57b188cbf5fbbc3c) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Add the `bim.store.*` namespace — high-level editing of an already-parsed
  `IfcDataStore` via the existing mutation overlay. Closes the merge-roundtrip
  gap from #592 (you can edit `IfcRectangleProfileDef.XDim` or drop a fresh
  `IfcColumn` into a model without round-tripping through a script + re-parse).

  **`@ifc-lite/mutations`** — new `StoreEditor` facade plus four
  `MutablePropertyView` extensions: positional-attribute mutations, overlay
  entity creation/deletion (with watermark seeding), and three helpers used by
  the viewer's undo/redo (`removePositionalMutation`, `restoreFromTombstone`,
  `restoreNewEntity`).

  **`@ifc-lite/create`** — new `in-store/` module: `addColumnToStore` builds a
  12-entity IfcColumn sub-graph (placement, profile, extruded solid,
  representation, product shape, rel-contained-in-spatial-structure) anchored
  to a target `IfcBuildingStorey`. `resolveSpatialAnchor` walks the parsed
  store to find the IfcOwnerHistory, the 'Body' representation context, and
  the storey's local placement.

  **`@ifc-lite/sdk`** — new `StoreNamespace` exposed as `bim.store` on
  `BimContext`. Methods: `addEntity`, `removeEntity`, `setPositionalAttribute`,
  `addColumn`. Backed by `StoreBackendMethods` on `BimBackend`; the
  `RemoteBackend` proxy round-trips them through the transport.

  **`@ifc-lite/sandbox`** — `bim.store.*` is bridged into the QuickJS sandbox
  with full TypeScript types via `bim-globals.d.ts` and an LLM cheat sheet in
  the system prompt. Gated on a new `store: true` permission (default
  `false`, mirrors the existing `mutate` permission pattern).

  **`@ifc-lite/cli`** — `HeadlessBackend.store` is now functional (was a
  no-op before). Scripts run via the CLI can edit a parsed model and export it
  with mutations applied.

  **`@ifc-lite/viewer`** — three new UI surfaces:

  - Raw STEP tab in `PropertiesPanel` — lists every positional STEP argument
    with an inline pen-icon editor for scalar values (numbers, refs, enums,
    null). Mutated rows show a purple dot and tinted background.
  - `EntityContextMenu` gains "Delete entity" (red, calls `removeEntity`
    with toast + undo support) and "Add column here…" (emerald, only enabled
    when the right-clicked entity is an `IfcBuildingStorey`).
  - `AddColumnDialog` modal — storey picker sorted by elevation, position
    (storey-local metres), cross-section, height, name, optional collapsible
    for Description/ObjectType/Tag. Anchor-resolution failures surface
    inline, not as thrown exceptions.

  Plus four new actions on `mutationSlice` (`setPositionalAttribute`,
  `removeEntity`, `addColumn`, dialog open/close) backed by per-model
  `StoreEditor` caches, with undo/redo wired for `UPDATE_POSITIONAL_ATTRIBUTE`,
  `CREATE_ENTITY`, and `DELETE_ENTITY`.

  **`@ifc-lite/parser`** — `package.json` `exports` re-ordered to put `types`
  before `import` so downstream consumers using TS5 `nodenext` resolution
  pick up the type declarations.

  **`@ifc-lite/geometry`** — re-exports `MetadataBootstrapEntitySummary` and
  `MetadataBootstrapSpatialNode` from the package index (used by viewer
  desktop services).

  **`@ifc-lite/renderer`** — `GPUBufferDescriptor` ambient declaration gains
  `mappedAtCreation?: boolean`. Internal change; the renderer was already
  using it at runtime to skip a Mojo IPC round-trip on Chrome/Dawn.

- [#598](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/598) [`25c9877`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/25c9877969d2dcccb9c4e61f57b188cbf5fbbc3c) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Duplicate-from-selection — pick any IfcRoot product, hit `⌘D` (or
  right-click → Duplicate), get a fully-functional clone. The
  duplicate is a first-class entity in the property panel, exports
  cleanly to STEP with all its property associations preserved, and
  ships in 6 directional variants sized to the source's bounding box.

  **`@ifc-lite/create`**

  - New `duplicateInStore(editor, source, options)` pure builder.
    Emits a fresh placement chain (`IfcCartesianPoint` →
    `IfcAxis2Placement3D` → `IfcLocalPlacement`) plus the duplicate
    `IfcRoot` with a new GUID and the source's `Representation`
    reference reused (geometry shared). Optional fresh
    `IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure` anchors to the source's
    storey. Offset is configurable via `options.offset` — the slice
    sizes it to the source's bbox.
  - New `resolveDuplicateSource(store, expressId)` walks the parsed
    `IfcDataStore` for placement / parent / location / storey /
    associations.
  - New `SourceAssociation` shape captures one
    `IfcRelDefines*` / `IfcRelAssociates*` edge that references
    the source. The builder replays each one against the duplicate
    so the exported STEP carries identical psets / qsets /
    materials / classifications / documents / type binding —
    without modifying any existing rel.
  - Resolver scans the five association rel types
    (`IFCRELDEFINESBYPROPERTIES`, `IFCRELDEFINESBYTYPE`,
    `IFCRELASSOCIATESMATERIAL`, `…CLASSIFICATION`, `…DOCUMENT`)
    by direct numeric membership in `RelatedObjects`.
  - `DuplicateBuildResult.associationRelIds: number[]` exposes the
    fresh rel ids for caller introspection.
  - 7 unit tests in `duplicate.test.ts`: full graph emission,
    custom offset, no-storey path, root-placement parent, attribute
    count guard, association replay (3 rel types in one go), and
    the no-associations case.

  **`@ifc-lite/mutations`**

  - New `setEntityAlias(overlayId, sourceId | null)` /
    `getEntityAlias(id)` / `resolveBaseEntityId(id)` public surface
    on `MutablePropertyView`. Aliases redirect base property and
    quantity reads from the duplicate to its source — so the
    duplicate inherits psets/qsets without eagerly cloning them
    into the overlay.
  - Override slots stay scoped to the original (overlay) id, so
    edits on the duplicate don't bleed into the source. Verified
    by 4 new unit tests including the source-untouched path,
    chain-cap (one hop, not transitive), and the self-alias guard.

  **`@ifc-lite/viewer`**

  - New `duplicateEntity(modelId, sourceExpressId, direction?)`
    slice action. Wraps the create-package builder, sets the
    mutation-view alias, and clones the source's mesh data into
    the geometry result with the offset applied — so the duplicate
    appears in 3D the moment the action fires, not just in the
    export overlay. Per-vertex `entityIds` arrays are filled with
    the new globalId so picking and selection resolve correctly.
  - New `DuplicateDirection` type (`+X` / `-X` / `+Y` / `-Y` /
    `+Z` / `-Z`). Magnitude per axis = the source's bounding-box
    dimension on that axis, so a 3m wall steps 3m and a 0.4m
    column steps 0.4m. Falls back to a 1m step when the source
    has no mesh in geometry.
  - Right-click menu's "Duplicate" item is now a `DuplicateRow`:
    primary clickable label on the left (defaults to +X), 6 axis
    chips on the right (→ ← ↗ ↙ ↑ ↓). Tooltips spell out
    "+X (east)" through "−Z (down)".
  - `⌘D` defaults to +X. `⇧⌘D` = +Z (up), `⌥⌘D` = +Y (north) —
    modifier shortcuts for power users without forcing a mouse
    trip to the chip row. Selection moves to the new globalId so
    a Cmd+D chain ("stamp a row of columns") works without
    re-clicking.
  - **`resolveGlobalIdFromModels` two-pass overlay fallback** —
    the federation resolver previously gated each model's id range
    at parse-time `maxExpressId`, which excluded every
    overlay-allocated id from selection. The fix: a second pass
    consults each model's mutation view via `getNewEntity(localId)`
    so overlay duplicates resolve to the right model with the
    right local id. Without this, the property panel saw the
    duplicate as "UNKNOWN / Unknown / no property sets" because
    the alias couldn't take effect on a wrongly-resolved id.
  - PropertiesPanel falls back to the overlay `NewEntity` record
    for type / name / GUID / Description / ObjectType when the
    parsed `entityNode` comes up empty. The bSDD attribute list
    synthesises from the schema-defined positional names. The
    Materials / Classifications / Documents / structural
    Relationships sections all route through a new
    `lookupExpressId` (alias-resolved) so they query the source's
    parsed maps directly.

  After: a freshly-duplicated wall is genuinely first-class — name
  reads, properties show, quantities show, material layers show,
  classifications show, documents show, and a round-tripped STEP
  file carries every association.

  CLI headless backend.

  **Create API** — `IfcCreator` gains `addIfcWorkSchedule`, `addIfcWorkPlan`,
  `addIfcTask` (with inline `IfcTaskTime`), `addIfcRelSequence` (with
  `IfcLagTime`), `assignTasksToWorkSchedule` (`IfcRelAssignsToControl`),
  `assignProductsToTask` (`IfcRelAssignsToProcess`), and `nestTasks`
  (`IfcRelNests`).

  **SDK** — new `bim.schedule` read namespace (`data()`, `tasks()`,
  `workSchedules()`, `sequences()`) backed by the parser's
  `extractScheduleOnDemand`. New `ScheduleBackendMethods` is now part of
  `BimBackend`; the viewer's `LocalBackend`, the `RemoteBackend` proxy, and the
  CLI `HeadlessBackend` all implement it.

  **Sandbox** — new `bim.schedule.*` QuickJS namespace plus schedule methods on
  `bim.create.*`, all carrying LLM semantic contracts so the auto-generated
  system prompt teaches the assistant when to use them. Autocomplete types
  (`bim-globals.d.ts`) regenerated.
