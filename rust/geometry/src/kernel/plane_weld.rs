//! Cross-operand near-coincidence promotion, split out of `mesh_bridge.rs`
//! (which sits at its module-size budget) when #3353 made it a boolean-wide
//! concern rather than a subtraction-only one.
//!
//! `mesh_bridge` snaps each operand's coordinates to [`SNAP_GRID`]
//! INDEPENDENTLY, so two faces a user authored flush can land a few µm apart.
//! Everything downstream then has to guess whether they are one surface or
//! two, and the kernel's stages do not guess alike: `broadphase` says "not
//! touching" on exact AABBs, `tritri::near_coplanar` and `classify`'s regime 1
//! both say "flush" on a [`NearBand`]. This module removes the guess at the
//! source by MOVING the vertex onto the plane, which is why it belongs before
//! the arrangement rather than inside the classifier.

/// Cross-operand near-coincidence promotion: weld every CUTTER vertex that
/// sits within the snap-scatter band of a HOST face plane — and projects
/// STRICTLY inside that face — onto the plane, then back onto the snap grid.
///
/// WHY (found by the kernel-parity sweep on a long tunnel-wall fixture): when
/// `extend_opening_mesh_through_host` pushes a flush opening cap along the
/// host depth axis `d`, a cap corner that was bit-exactly a HOST corner can
/// slide ALONG a host face plane that contains `d` (here: the wall END face).
/// In exact arithmetic the slid corner stays on that plane, but the f32 round
/// of `p + d·shift` lands it a few µm OFF — a TILTED gap below the per-axis
/// `SNAP_GRID` reconcile (per-axis snapping cannot flatten a tilt). The host
/// EDGE then GRAZES the cutter jamb FACE at ~5e-5 rad; the conforming
/// arrangement splits the grazed face into degenerate sub-triangles whose
/// keep/drop classification is undefined → open edges + inverted volume
/// (the parity sweep's negative-volume family: 27 tris / vol −4.268 / 13 bad
/// edges from two CLEAN watertight 12-tri boxes).
///
/// The gate is PLANE-level, deliberately NOT footprint-level: in the repro the
/// cutter jamb face is PARALLEL to the host end face but 4× longer, so its
/// verts perpendicular-project 0.18–0.4 m OUTSIDE the end face's footprint —
/// a point-in-face containment test can never associate them, yet their plane
/// IS the host plane up to f32 noise. A sub-band parallel-plane separation is
/// never representable design intent (the band is three orders below the
/// smallest real feature edge, ~0.2 m — same argument as
/// `near_on_surface_normal`), so welding the vertex onto the plane only
/// removes noise. The CUTTER-ONLY direction suffices and never perturbs the
/// host. The band and its far-from-origin widening mirror
/// `near_on_surface_normal`: [`NearBand`], sized PER HOST PLANE from the
/// operands' per-axis extents projected onto that plane's own normal
/// (8·SNAP_GRID until the projected extent passes ~512 CALLER units, not metres
/// (#2684), so an offset along an axis this plane does not face never widens it).
/// DETERMINISM: plain FMA-free f64 over
/// already-snapped coords, fixed iteration order, nearest-plane ties broken
/// by face index ⇒ byte-identical native==wasm. Every pinned box−box
/// manifest is transversal (no cutter vertex within the band of a
/// non-incident host plane), so the promotion never fires there.
