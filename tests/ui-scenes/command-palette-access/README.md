# Complete command-palette feature access — #8947

This is a separate hillclimb from the accepted general UX in #8946 / PR #8950.
Maximum eight review rounds. No numerical taste score proves completeness.

## Goal and boundary

Every user-facing viewer feature, tool and action must be reachable by a functioning
palette action or a clearly named destination opening its real flow. Use canonical
registry actions and existing tool hosts. A destination must disclose its child
path; simply opening a parent panel does not establish access to every child.
Include ribbon, menus, panels, contextual actions, modeling, settings, exports,
extensions, runtime commands, recovery controls and keyboard-only capabilities.
Record duplicate entry points and display-only controls explicitly.

The access contract ends at real configuration/review/launch controls. It does not
require publishing remote changes or spending money to exercise every parameter.
Applicable prerequisites, cancellation and unavailable/error recovery must work.
Preserve file-picker user activation, canonical model loading and selection channels.

## Independent baseline and evidence

Accepted UX source: `9d476f01e7b2bfc1e69799d39a1b0289d6a6e2d3`, tree
`63f8396b08b2271c02364336e14f8f8acd0b41a4`. Parent branch adds documentation only.
The UX screenshots establish inherited presentation, not feature coverage.
Source preparation identified 39 registry omissions and additional modeling/subflow
gaps. All source-connected mappings start unverified until behavior is observed.
The inventory must retain source control, canonical action, palette ID, ordered
child controls, aliases, prerequisites, observation and remaining gap for each row.

Required contexts: unloaded; loaded without selection; loaded with selection.
Cross applicable rows with single/federated model, renderer/property selection,
editable/read-only role, installed/enabled/disabled/missing extension, and conditional
modules. Use real bundled IFC or parsed STEP fixtures. Explicitly mark unavailable
hardware/provider/build contexts; do not count skipped scenarios as passed.

## Frozen rubric and vetoes

1. Inventory completeness: every source capability maps or has a stated exclusion.
2. Functioning destination: exact canonical flow and named child controls are reachable.
3. Task-language search: clear aliases find the intended action without misleading labels.
4. Context truth: prerequisites and remedies remain visible and update live.
5. Keyboard and grouping: readable labels, discoverable disabled rows, stable focus/selection.
6. UX preservation: accepted #8946 interactions and layout remain intact.

Missing capability, broken destination, silent no-op, stale eligibility execution,
file-picker activation loss or accepted-UX regression veto completion. Fresh Opus
judges taste, Astra reviews reasoning, Codex implements. No competing source writers.
Each round records source, changes, independent objections, test receipts, visual
and behavioral evidence, accept/reject decision and remaining gaps separately.

| Round | Status | Changes / hypothesis | Evidence / verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Implementation in progress | Unified static projection, visible availability and canonical destinations close omissions | Baseline inventory reconciliation and behavioral evidence pending; no acceptance |

Implementation batches inside a round are not separate acceptance rounds. Keep
reviewable PR layers for #8947 if the implementation exceeds roughly 1500 lines.
Release requires full root Turbo coverage, real UI evidence, post-commit pre-handoff,
required CI and resolved reviews. Mergify only, after base is main. Parent handles
watching and production verification; never claim a merge is a deployment.
